## Introduction

In R, there are several plotting engines, but the three major ones are the base {graphics} package (here called "base plot"), {lattice} and {ggplot2}. Each of them has its own philosophy and syntax. The plots they produce have distinctive look, even if they can be tailored to different styles. The {chart} package provides a unified interface to these three plotting engines.

The goal of {chart} is:

-   to provide a unified interface to the three major plotting engines in R;
-   to make all three types of plots intercompatible in a composite figure;
-   to propose a default style for the plots that is consistent across the three engines and close enough to a publication-ready style;
-   to use automatically labels and units for axes, when possible;
-   to expose an formula-base interface as an alternative for {ggplot2} users;
-   to implement various (customisable) plot types for different R objects.
