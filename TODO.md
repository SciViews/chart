# chart To Do list

-   `autoplot()` and `plot()` methods (+ `hist()`, etc.)

-   Implement `.DollarNames()` to get a list of `chart()` types available, with a mechanism to add more types from additional packages.

-   Refine themes and look at themes for {lattice} and base.

-   Use labels for base and {lattice} plots.
